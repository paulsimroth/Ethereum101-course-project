# Ethereum101-course-project

In this repository you can find my project I did in order to complete the Solidity course at Moralis Academy.

The Wallet Project was for the Ethereum Smart Contract Programming 101 Course at Moralis Academy which I completed on Nov. 8th 2021.
It is a multi signature wallet where you need the approval of the Admins to complete a transaction.
