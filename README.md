# solidity-course-projects

In this repository you can find my projects I did in order to complete the Solidity courses at Moralis Academy.

The Wallet Project was for the Ethereum Samrt Contract Programming 101 Course which I completed on Nov. 8th 2021.
It is a multi signature wallet where you need the approval of 2/3 Admins to complete a transaction.
